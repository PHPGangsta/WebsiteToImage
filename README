Taking screenshot from website
reating a simple manual screenshot of a website is easy, I don't need to explain it here. However, 
if you want to create screenshots of websites from your PHP application or if you don't feel like copying them together manually because 
the website is very long or wide, the wkhtmltopdf project helps . 
This command line tool is available for Windows, Linux and Mac, and it also runs on servers without a graphical user interface. 
Both wkhtmltopdf and wkhtmltoimage can be found on the project's website. wk stands for the Webkit Render Engine, which creates either a PDF
or an image (jpg, png, tiff) from a given HTML input.
